Content: Great and simple to install. An easy way to switch up an old dusty dingy or corded type blind to  this easy to roll up cordless one. Reasonably priced and cut to size (free!) if your window not a standard size. Should be in top 10 deal list !

Title: Damaged item was packed and sent
Content: Decently made except the upper rail was severely dented on arrival and NOT from shipping as the box itself was in perfect condition!  Unfortunately my mother needed this item in place immediately so am unable to return it and wait for a replacement unit, as that would leave her window uncovered even longer.

Title: End-Caps hassle
Content: Well I just installed a bunch of these cut-to-fit 1” blinds in some apartments, so no word on longevity  etc.

But can say during install you will likely spend more time dinking around getting the plastic end-caps to fit and stay on than anything else.
The bottom caps were fine, but the upper sheet metal just isn’t formed precise enough to match the plastic end-caps.
Or possibly the metal is deformed during cutting, dunno.
To keep the caps on I glued (on inside) with E-6000 (like Shoe-Goo).

Content: The slats broke within a couple of years with normal use.  I have never had any corded blinds slats break like this except rarely at the tips if crushed or bent hard.  This is a very cheaply made product made from inferior materials.

Title: Measurements not to be trusted.
Content: I ordered a set of 59” blinds stating that actual width would be 58.5. Blinds arrived 58.75 and will not fit. This is a gross oversight and as such are unusable. They can not easily be cut to size due to a metal headrail. 

Do not recommend due to invite is with the product dimensions.

Content: The Unbranded White Cordless Room
Darkening Vinyl Mini Blinds with 1 in. Slats-51 in. W x 48 in. L was as advertised and expected. It does a good job at dimming the room from outside light on a sunny day, However , if you are one that likes to sleep in the day in a dark room, this option might not be for you. I have had this installed for about two weeks and have been very happy with the results. It was relatively easy to set up and use. I would recommend this for anyone looking for window privacy with the added benefit of dimming the room.

Title: Frame Rail was Bent
Content: I waited six days for this to come and when I receive it, it’s got a terrible bend in the top rail. And it’s the front part of the rail not the back where it could be hidden after hanging. Not happy with this, and these mini blinds cost more than the regular ones because they’re an odd size 25.5 inch. Home Depot needs to make this right.

 I miss the blinds with the cords.  
I have no pets/kids to be concerned with entanglements, and they work so much easier & better than the new cordless type.

I purchased a total of six blinds over four separate purchases (two of those purchases were replacements of the initial ones purchased), five online and one in the store and EVERY ONE OF THEM had an issue with the wand being difficult to turn and making a crunching sound as it was turning.  Unfortunately, I had to return all of them, although the return was very easy-peasy.

Content: Large plastic end caps are IMPOSSIBLE to install properly. Made an otherwise easy to install blind a PIA. The metal distortion and burrs left behind during the sizing/cutting process make it even more difficult.  I can see why they don't install them at the factory. The plastic cap doesn't quite match the profile of the top rail.  If you do manage to install them, they fall off easily. Bottom caps on small lower rail seem to fit properly.  If you enjoy aggravation and frustration, buy these blinds.

Pros- easy to install, adjustable length if needed, able to pin the bottom rail in place so it doesn’t swing with door opening, able to purchase in many different sizes, light weight so they aren’t going to fall off.
Con-  I don’t feel like the shade closes completely- I can stand outside and not see in, but from the inside it seems like the slats should touch and they don’t.

You will want to have a flat head screwdriver to pull the bracket blind clips down when mounting the blinds. Otherwise it would be really tough to push them in. Looks good once up. Very happy with them so far.

I ordered a 59.5 x 48 white room darkening blind which arrived with a dent in the middle of  upper hanging bracket on the front side.  The box was intact and the damage only showed up when we opened it.  We hung it anyway and hope that the dent does not affect the blind operation.

Content: Who knew that a little box from the home improvement store would turn out to be my new best friend? Enter the White Cordless Room Darkening Vinyl Mini Blinds with 1-inch Slats - a.k.a. the sleep saviors! 

After installing these beauties, which was as easy as pie (and trust me, I can barely screw in a lightbulb), my room transformed into a bat cave. No more early morning sun glaring into my eyes! Now, it's all smooth, serene darkness, perfect for weekend lie-ins.

The cordless design means there’s nothing for my cat to destroy, a real plus because Mr. Whiskers is a known blind-mangler. Not only do they keep the light out, but they also have that sleek, minimalist look that says, "I’m an adult who has my life together." 

Five stars for helping me, and my cat, sleep better! These blinds are the window dressing equivalent of a lullaby sung by angels – except, you know, more durable and easier to clean.

The blinds are plastic but look good and last a long time. I love that Home Depot cuts it to size and it’s easy to shorten after installing.

Content: Love the cordless feature, but the slats don't really room darken enough. Thicker slats and closer together would help.

Content: Overall decent blind but the end caps do not fit. I purchased 6 sets and they look terrible as a result.

Title: Quality Suffers
Content: This product is a downgraded version, the install brackets small and barely holds it in place. Priced at $20.47, I feel that it should be a little bit better. I take a neutral on recommendation. Having install 100's of blinds this one at least meets bare minimum. I will not purchase these in the future.

Content: I love these blinds because u don’t have to pull them, u just put your hands under the bottom ends and lift up. They are simply great and easy to lift.
