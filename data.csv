,"Microwave oven seems to be a great product so far. Cooks well, and connects to the WiFi and app easily. The vent settings work well, and high has plenty of power.

So modern looking,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] So far, with all the microwaves we’ve had in the last 17 years I think this is the 4th and our first LG brand, this thing really looks pretty and so modern cause it has WiFi connection. Aside from looks, the build is pretty solid, easy to install, heats up food so fast and alerts you on your phone when it’s done. Downside for me is, it really attracts finger prints smudges on the stainless and glass part and they’re very hard to take off. Other than that, so far so good.

,"When the delivery man arrived with new microwave, he knew it was too big, and wasn’t going to fit even though I gave exact measurements when ordered. Delivery men took away the old, working microwave and the new microwave was subsequently taken away (still in the box), now I have no microwave and a big hole in the wall where the original, working microwave was. They should have just re-installed the old one instead of taking it away. Home Depot’s remedy was to merely give a discount on another microwave. This was at the same time I purchased a $900. new LG stove from them. Their customer service needs serious improvement!",1,2024-08-14T18:06:35.000+00:00,Anna1999,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

Simple yet sophisticated,"We upgraded our stove and decided to upgrade our hood.  This LG product complimented the stove.  The ThinQ app connects easily and you can choose to have the light and fan come on with the stove burners.  The other features are easy to use.  The vent fans default to room venting but you can vent them to a ""chimney"" vent.  I found the underneath halogen bulb is HOT!  Too hot to the touch and inside the microwave heats up if the light is on.  I replaced it with an LED GY6.35 bulb.",5,2024-05-11T12:36:20.000+00:00,SEHale,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

"Beautiful, easy to use, lots of friendly features!","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] This just made life easier! I’ve owned this for over a month and it’s used several times every day. This is the first microwave I’ve owned where I actually use all the features. It’s easy to figure out, and has so many useful and wonderful features that it’s hard to choose my favorite. The reheat is a feature I’m surprised I use, but it is so smart and senses before it heats. An even heat/cook. I use the app, which is another surprise. But it makes being a busy mom a little easier. Love that the vent turns on when I turn the stove burner on, too! The family has yet to make a mess because with the sensing features it is not likely to overcook or boil over and make a mess. The buttons are like a touch screen, so when I wipe the surface there’s no accidental start up yet all it takes is a gentle touch of the finger to start. A very user friendly microwave considering all the features. Highly recommend.",5,2024-04-11T22:04:26.000+00:00,CookieMom,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

It sings too,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] We purchased our LG microwave as part of an LG stainless-steel finger print resistant suite. It is so nice to enjoy the unique settings this microwave offers. My wife uses the popcorn setting as an example. She says every bag of popcorn gets done perfectly, no kernels go unpopped which is very nice. It looks so nice right above our LG stainless steel range. We did a lot of comparing of all the major brand kitchen suites and there was no doubt that the LG suite was for above all the others in quality and appeal. We are so glad we purchased all our appliances for our new kitchen from LG! Let me add that the individual tones the LG microwave plays for each operation is unique and makes using much more enjoyable!

Microwave - LG Bob,Great microwave. Blends in well with all the existing LG appliances we purchased. It had the ability to connect to existing outside venting. It is very quite while operating. The stove lighting is perfect. It completely lights up the top of the LG stove we purchased. We also can use the light in the dim mode as a night light. The two speed exhaust fan works flawless and is quieter than initially expected. It heats food evenly and the defrost cycle works very well. Thus unit also supports LG ThinkQ.,5,2023-04-17T18:56:18.000+00:00,HomeDepotCustomer,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

This LG microwave is actually a SM,"The specs for this microwave are incorrect. It's advertised as having a 1.8 cu ft capacity, but it's noticeably smaller than our previous 1.8 cu ft Frigidaire microwave. I measured the internal dimensions which are 9.25x19.5x13.75"". This equals 1.44 cu ft, significantly less than the 1.8 cu ft. The interior height is almost a couple of inches shorter than our old microwave. (Our old microwave was 1.76 cu ft when I measured and calculated it.) 

We've only had the microwave for a few days, and generally like it so far, but we're disappointed by the gross misrepresentation of its cooking capacity.",3,2024-11-19T02:03:31.000+00:00,RichardD,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

LG Review (not HD) - Customer Support Experience,"We bought this microwave in Feb of this year. It stopped working completely in Oct for not apparent reason. We did not buy the extended protection plan but we were happy to learn that LG offers a 12 month manufacturers warranty. I reached out to LG on 10/6 to find out what steps we needed to take to get support/help on this issue. Despite more than 6 phone calls over the last 4 weeks and an attempted repair by their 3rd party repair company, we still don't have a resolution or a microwave.

Not Good,"I bought a suite of LG when we moved to a new to us home, three years ago. We got a fridge, dishwasher, microwave, and dishwasher. The microwave heats up things but the digital display does not work and has been getting worse for a year and now is broke completely. The dishwasher makes all kinds of new sounds that it shouldn’t be making. The gas oven is ok, but has temperature holding issues. The fridge is great so far, but I won’t be purchasing LG and I would suggest you do the same.",2,2024-07-24T18:57:51.000+00:00,Tommy,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

,"The dimensions weren’t specific enough about the thickness of the door. Since the door is so thick the microwave sits too deep in my cabinet to open the door when mounted in the wall. The paper schematic used to drill the holes for hanging was inaccurate but just a smidge, but enough I had to drill twice right beside the “correct” hole. The turning plate falls off the wheels often, could have been drained better there I think.

Working as expected.,"We bought this a few months ago and it's been working great, no problems with any of the functions so far.  Seems to be well built when you open the door it does not sag like some we looked at.  One thing we noticed is that they are still using a 50W halogen bulb for a light.  While cleaning the underside it was very hot to the touch because of the bulb being used.

Very poor venting,"I set it up for roof venting (and tested it before installing it to be sure). Once installed, I tested with a smoke emitter. Despite being set up for roof venting, there is still some air coming through the front (about 25% of the total based on the amount of smoke). Also, the suction at the bottom is way less than the 300CFM listed on the page: I tested using 200CFM smoke emitter and my house still filled with smoke.

,"LG kitchen appliances. Products meet expectations. Delivery was horrible. You can’t communicate with the delivery company, all you’re allowed to do is schedule a day.

They called at 09:30 on delivery day saying they were at our house, so she had to rush home.  They hooked all the appliances up correctly but didn’t take the extra 5 mins to adjust the leveling feet.  So now I have to pull the oven and the fridge back out and adjust them so they don’t wobble.

Great microwave,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] As a proud owner of this appliance, I am compelled to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with this culinary powerhouse.

First and foremost, let's talk about design. The LG Microwave boasts a sleek and contemporary exterior that instantly elevates the aesthetic appeal of any kitchen space. Its compact yet spacious interior is ingeniously crafted to accommodate a variety of dishes, making it ideal for both solo meals and family feasts. The intuitive control panel is user-friendly, allowing for seamless navigation and hassle-free operation, even for those less technologically inclined.

But it's not just about looks - this microwave packs a punch when it comes to performance. Equipped with advanced heating technologies, it delivers consistent and thorough cooking results every time. Whether you're defrosting leftovers, popping popcorn for movie night, or whipping up a gourmet meal in a hurry, the LG Microwave handles it all with effortless precision. With customizable cooking settings and power levels, you have full control over your culinary creations, ensuring they turn out exactly the way you envision.

One standout feature of the LG Microwave is its innovative sensor cooking capabilities. By intelligently detecting moisture levels and adjusting cooking times accordingly, it takes the guesswork out of meal preparation, guaranteeing perfectly cooked dishes with minimal effort. This not only saves time but also ensures that your food retains its flavor, texture, and nutritional value, leaving you free to focus on other tasks or simply sit back and relax.

In addition to its stellar performance, the LG Microwave prioritizes safety and convenience. The child lock feature provides peace of mind, especially in households with curious little ones, while the easy-clean interior makes post-cooking maintenance a breeze. Furthermore, its energy-efficient operation helps reduce power consumption without compromising on performance, making it an eco-conscious choice for environmentally conscious consumers.

In conclusion, the LG Microwave is more than just a kitchen appliance - it's a game-changer. With its winning combination of style, functionality, and innovation, it has earned its rightful place as a staple in homes around the world. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a culinary novice, this powerhouse of a microwave will revolutionize the way you cook, allowing you to unleash your culinary creativity with confidence and ease.

Mad at myself,"I was so excited about buying a new refrigerator, dishwasher, stove and over the range microwave that I ordered the wrong one.  I called customer service to see if we could fix it but I was told I should have called during the 48 hours as it would have been fixable.  I got the delivery very late on Friday so I assumed the 48hrs would be business days so I called in the am on Monday.  Too late....I guess my misunderstanding was more important to home depot than me feeling happy.  I strongly suggest shopping around for good customer service...I swear I wanted to scream if I had to hear one more time that I should have called during the 48 hours and that they didn't care if I was unhappy.  During the 48 hours they could have swapped that out no proble but call 12 hours after the 48 hours expired and you are out of luck.

Love it!,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I purchased this December 23, 2023 and had it installed January 9, 2004. As of now I'm very pleased with the product. It's attractive and goes well with my other appliances. I read complaints ranging for the fan being to noisy, to the light being too harsh and hot, to the music being played when a product has finished cooking. I find no fault with any of these claims. The fan is a little loud when set to high, but reasonable on a lower speed. The lights are good and I enjoy the music rather than a sharp tone telling me cooking is finished. Overall, I'm quite pleased, beginning with installation and setup to use of the microwave. Good product!",5,2024-01-20T17:03:40.000+00:00,David R D,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

Do Not Buy LG Microwave,We bought this LG microwave 6 months ago. It required 2 installation visits and it has now has an electrical problem. The service person did not have an official diagnosis so he was just ordering door switch and electric filter board in hopes that it will fix the problem. We will now have a microwave with replacement parts and the potential to break again after the one year warranty. LG customer service will not refund or give us a replacement.

Called customer service again - was told someone would be out at the end of the week to fix it.  Call never came.  When we called about a time for them to come out, was told the microwave didn't fit right and there was nothing they could do.  Also said we couldn't return it because it was past the 48 hour window, even though we had originally called in less than 24 hours and them not calling us back was the reason for the delay.

The LED light inside the microwave died less than a year after I bought the microwave. Online the LG site shows an easy way to replace the lightbulb but this does not work for this microwave.

one issue,"[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Functionally it is fine, MY only complaint is there is a 50 watt halogen light under the microwave to light up the range cook top.  When that light is used as a night light, it heats up the inside of the microwave bottom.  There is only one size LED with the right length of pins, HOWEVER being its shape is live a flat disc.

Great Microwave!,"Decided to purchase LG for all my kitchen appliances. First was the microwave. Installed it with a friend. No issues. Been using it for a month and has been easy to use.

"I'll make it work, but.....","[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] The MVEM1825F Over the Range Microwave is good, bringing additional settings that my family finds helpful. However, I am not a fan of the auto-cook feature that starts when you press a number between 1 and 6. I wish this was a two step process to increase safety and flexibility; perhaps using an Auto-cook button followed by my 1 through 6 minute choice. This would make Time-cook easier as well, which is a feature I lost from my last LG over-the-range microwave.
I also am disappointed that LG chose to decrease the microwave cook chamber depth and increase the the cook chamber width to maintain the overall cubic volumn. This also shows up with the much smaller (now 12.5in from the old 14in) turntable. Now I have 6 inches of unusable width (3in on either side of the turntable) cook chamber space. Sure, LG will tell me I can use that space by shutting off the turntable, but that creates more problems cooking food than is solves.
I'll make it work, but I'll be looking for better options next time.

I not recommend this product!,"I scanned the microwave at Home Depot, which was on the display with a retractable hood, but as I just now noticed that I was deceived and was not sold what I wanted. I am very uncomfortable with this situation. Maybe this is a mistake of the person who helped me place an order, who works in this store? I do not know. I order a lot from Home Depot, there were different situations, but this has already crossed all borders!!!",1,2023-11-15T03:08:33.000+00:00,Serg,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.

Beautiful and cooks great!,"I've had this product for 9 months now. It looks beautiful in my kitchen and cleans up really well! It has cooked everything superbly until we tried cooking a whole chicken. We have a special microwave dish and cover for cooking a whole chicken in a microwave that we have used numerous times because the chicken comes out so moist. However, during the cooking of the chicken, this microwave decided to just run and not cook anymore, it didn't matter what we tried, it just wouldn't cook any more. That lasted for about 3 to 5 days, our microwave wouldn't cook. Somehow during the process of trying to cook a bag of popcorn the microwave mysteriously decided to warm the popcorn, we forgot the microwave wasn't working. We put the popcorn bag in a second time and it actually cooked it and has been cooking fine ever since. I'm not sure why the microwave wouldn't cook for 3 to 5 days, but it works great now. I'm thinking it must have gotten into demo mode somehow.",4,2023-11-04T16:30:04.000+00:00,cdbcb,321666159,LG 1.8 cu. ft. 30 in.
