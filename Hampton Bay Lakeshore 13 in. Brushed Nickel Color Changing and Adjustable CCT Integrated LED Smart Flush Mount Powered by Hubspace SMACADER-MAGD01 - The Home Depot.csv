2023-01-30T10:33:38,5,Excellent light for indoor or outdoor,"I have two of these installed, one in my kitchen and one outside by my front door. The light is bright, works well, and is an excellent value for the cost. The color-changing is a very nice option, especially outside. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️",Hans
2022-08-18T00:48:40,1,Absolutely trash!!!,"The light was working fine while I had my original phone. My phone fell in water so I upgraded, now I can't connect to the light EVEN AFTER REMOVING IT FROM THE ACCOUNT AND ATTEMPTING TO REINSTALL. The app just continues to wait on the light to respond. There is no factory reset option for this light. I looked everywhere for a way to reset it. Good luck if you switch phones. I'll be tossing this, good thing I haven't added any other hubsmart based products yet! Currently stuck on 1% red...",JasonSs
2022-02-23T16:25:07,4,Is this really flush?,"Bigger than thought, I would consider surface mount as opposed to flush.  A lot easier to set up to Wifi and the App is faster (so far, 10 lights on other app) and easier to use than another brand of lights I own.  They are a little too thick (I can relate personally to it on this) and large for original plan, going to switch these around a bit. Light is solid red, picture isn't accurate.",Brian

2022-01-07T02:58:08,5,Great white framed light and bright too.,"I picked two of these for our friend's house after they purchased a house nearby our house. The light fixture was super easy to install and took about 10 minutes to hang a double check it before mounting it to ceiling. This was the white framed light for their hallway into kitchen, and stronger light was needed. The light fixture is very bright and low glare as frosted lens. The fixture is very easy to install and took 10 minutes tops to put up.",Miller Tyme
2022-01-07T02:51:47,5,Great amount of light and no glare.,This light is amazingly bright and looks very good and without any glare. I installed this light fixture at a friend's house they just purchased recently near our house. The light is bigger than many other fixtures I looked at for their needs and the amount of clean light is very bright. The kit comes with all you need to install fixture and EZ installation.,Miller Tyme
2022-01-04T03:53:33,5,Modern in Every Way,"This light has a modern look and modern technology well implemented.  Installation is so easy since the fixture is very light, and it is easy to see through the mounting holes to locate the screws on the mounting bracket or in the perimeter of the electrical box.  While the light diffusing cover may not be made of heavy plastic is seems adequate for the job of distributing light.  It nice not having to worry about chipping, dropping, or cracking a glass cover but still having an attractive light.  But what I like best is the Hubspace app control of the light.   That starts with using the QR code to being device connection and continues through the extremely easy connection to Alexa from within the Hubspace app.  I use an Android phone by Motorola and my wife uses an iPhone and the app works well on both.  I got her to installing remotely and shared my credentials with her for this app and she was able to operate the light from her Mom’s house.  In order to use Alexa, you merely say, ""Alexa, turn on (off) [light name given in app]"" without referencing Hubspace.  I am considering ditching my Wink hub in the future once there are enough products that work with Hubspace.  Hope The Home Depot continues the philosophy of no monthly fees.  I have included the instructions on the box, which also has the QR code in the same area along with pictures of the LED array, and the back of the fixtures.",HomeDepotCustomer
2021-12-23T15:34:57,4,Bright and Groovy,"I love technology, especially after beta testing. This light fixture does it all very well - bright, dramatic color effects and ambiance, shallow profile, energy efficient, and an easy install. I'm new to the the Hubspace wifi app but it's clean, straightforward, and completely versatile in setting brightness, color temperature, color spectrum, schedule, and remote operation.

In all app control scenarios, power to the fixture has to remain on, but once preferred settings are made, they stick when toggled off and on from the wall switch. Like most apps of this kind, I abhor the privacy terms which allow collection of a lot of device, network, and user profile info beyond the light's operation. But those are the terms and If I want their tech, I have to accept them. The app took a while to find my network and install but it kept me posted on progress. It required both Bluetooth and GPS active (so it can collect your physical property address). However, in normal operation after setup, they need not be active.

The housing is contemporary and understated - it becomes invisible for the most part. The light diffuser works well and removes easily, but it's woefully delicate. It's very lightweight and installed quickly. I'd definitely recommend it to others!",HomeDepotCustomer

2021-12-13T17:30:56,5,"sleek and stylish, very functional, retains settings when power OFF/ON","A great upgrade from an old original contractor light.  This light is sleek and modern and extremely functional.  It's very bright and adjustable through an entire range from low light to very bright in addition to light temperature from a yellowish to bright white.  The app works well and is very easy to integrate, in my case, with Alexa.  Its low profile makes it suitable in areas with lower ceilings.  Although, I mounted it in a high stairwell leading to the second floor.  Nice and bright for that area.  It was very easy to install, probably the easiest I have come across.  It took about twenty minutes for one person to install, download the app and integrate with my smart home functionality.  The light retains its settings when using the power switch rather than the app to turn it on/off.  A nice feature.",MIKE
2021-12-12T23:48:58,5,great light!,"This smart light is pretty neat. It has a lot of different colors you can change to. It was easy to install and looks great! The Google and Amazon functions work well, and they were easy to connect. The lights are very bright no matter which color you choose. It is made by Hampton Bay. It is thirteen inches round and has a dark matte finish. The cover is a frosted white opaque color.",carolh
2021-12-06T20:48:55,5,I really like this light,"The Hampton Bay light is incredible. It is fully adjustable in color temperature and also brightness.

Anyone with basic electrical knowledge can install this in under a hour.",flyhard

It puts out 1400 lm, while using only 20 watts , with a efficiency of 70 lm per a watt , and a color accuracy of 90 CRI. Is suitable for use in damp locations. It includes installation Instructions with pictures As well as instructions with pictures on how to connect it to your wireless  or Bluetooth.

2021-11-11T02:24:17,5,Perfect,"We needed an overhead light fixture for a remodel, one that was low profile, had clean, simple lines, but cast plenty of light. This Hampton Bay Lakeshore 13 inch Smart Hubspace CCT and RGB Work Selectable LED Flush Mount fixture fits our need perfectly. The light has a nicely modern look to it and the flush mount low profile design takes up minimal headroom. The Corelated Color Temperature (CCT) selectable feature gives you complete selection over the color temperature, from warm white to cool white. The RGB (red,green,blue) selectable feature even allows for other colors, not something we'll use in our closet, but fun perhaps in other applications. And, like many current household appliances and fixtures, this light is remote controllable through Amazon or Google, or using Hubspace. Installation of this fixture is very simple and well within the skill set of the average homeowner. I really like this fixture and highly recommend it!",HomeDepotCustomer
2021-11-10T17:16:21,5,A Light of Many Colors,"I have always been impressed by Hampton Bay (a brand of The Home Depot) products. The Hampton Bay Lakeshore 13 in. Matte White Smart Selectable LED CCT and RGB Flush Mount Work with HUBSPACE App works with various smart apps like Google Home, etc. and installed flawlessly. The instructions were precise and easy to follow. The fixture itself is basic in appearance but looks sleek and modern. The metal housing is of a much thicker gauge than other light fixtures I have installed. I selected this lamp for my laundry area based on its brightness. However, I can see people purchasing this light more for the novelty of the changing colors and various levels of brightness. This light would go great in a kids bedroom where they can be entertained by the light while going to sleep. The app lets you change light intensity, and color. You can even use the “Rainbow” function that continuously changes the color of the light, then once the kids are asleep, you can turn off the light without disturbing the sleeping little ones. You can change the color based on the season. I don’t use any voice activated apps like Google Assistant or Alexa, but I would guess they would function well based on the ease of the initial setup. Hampton Bay seems to be out front in using the HUBSPACE app and I wouldn’t expect anything less from them.",Azretired
2021-11-09T12:04:23,5,'Power-On Behavior' is Great App Feature!,"I have the Black version and reviewed it already.  The White is exactly the same, but for the color, and as of this review, the price is $10 cheaper.  They shipped these in their original packaging (which has minimal padding), and did not add tape to the closure flap.  The White arrived open; missing the wire nuts, directions and one side of the foam padding.  The light was dented (see pics).  If I had bought it from Home Depot, I would have returned it, but being free from Seeds, I just mounted the dented side towards the wall.  The installation is slightly different than most, there is no mounting bar.  It mounts directly to the Electrical Box.  You need to remove the Lens, and tighten the screws from the inside.  The Lens and Diodes work well to evenly distribute the light (i.e. no dark areas on lens or cast below).  They are  RGB (see pic of it lit Red).  The best feature, is the Apps 'Power-On Behavior'.  My entire house is Smart.  When I lose power, even for a few seconds, most lights turn On when power is restored.  I have to turn them Off  (which is difficult to do when I am sleeping or not home).  When power is restored, Power-On Behavior, lets you chose if they should be On or Off.  Best New Smart Feature in years!  Not sure why all Apps do not have this?!?!",TheDogsCar
2021-11-08T18:08:56,5,LOVE this light!!!,"This 13"" diameter light is perfect for any décor or room!  Simple design and super easy to install.  It's built in LED lights require no bulbs and lasts for decades (50,000 hours).  The Hubspace app gets downloaded to your phone and you can control the white lights (dimmable, goes from soft white light to bright daylight white) and also is able to control the color you desire from the full spectrum color wheel.  Of course you can also turn the light on and off from the wall switch too. You can also set a schedule for this fixture to turn on and off using the free app on your smartphone. This fixture took only about 10 minutes to connect to the existing wiring from my previous ceiling fixture.  You can also pair this to your Alexa or Google Assistant.  The instructions were easy to follow and fixture comes with a 5-year warranty and is Energy Star rated.  The price is great for all the features you get and I'm going to buy more for other rooms in my house!  I love it!",HomeDepotCustomer
2021-11-06T02:00:28,5,Hampton Bay Lakeshore 13 in flush mount is nice simple fixture,"Very simple fixture and is good for all you smart light fans and can do all kinds of stuff with the hubspace app. Lithe is 2700 to 6500 K at 1400 lumens (that is equal to 90watt incandescent) and is dimmable. Install is very very easy just mount the fixture to the box after connecting the wires tighten the screws, place the lens on the fixture and twist to tighten ( if you have problems installing the lens you can use a suction cup to install or remove. All in all is a good not very costly fixture that is great for hallways, closets, laundry rooms, etc",FrankF
2021-11-05T17:00:11,5,Nice simple LED Wifi light,"This is a nice simple design, goes with any decor.  It is WiFi and can connect to Alexa which makes it very helpful.  It was so easy to install and connect.  Download the Hubspace app and you can control the light on/off and the temperature of the light too.  Connecting to Alexa is also easy.  We are using this in our basement, which will be helpful when carrying things down the steps I can alert Alexa and turn on.  You can change to colors and use the colors on different themes.  Nice options.",Mrsocks
2021-11-05T02:24:38,5,Easy Installation & Smart Control,"I needed more light for the area where we have an in-home sauna.  Having a light with color and brightness control seemed like a nice idea to set a mood while sitting in the.  The current switch doesn’t feature built-in dimming.  And then there is the Hubspace app for control that I will discuss near the end of this review.  Installation: This has to be one of the easiest ceiling lights to install.  Since it is a LED light with very low heat buildup, there is no fiberglass insulation, which means no itching or searching for the screws in electrical box through the fiberglass maze.  Just connect the black, white and ground (copper) wires to the one in the ceiling box.  The fixture is light enough that this job isn’t that difficult.  The only thing that might have made this easier is quick-connect push-type terminals versus conventional wire nuts that are provided.  There are 2 sets of slots to accommodate different screw locations on the electrical box. Much of the fixture fits flush against the ceiling so the screws provided should work even if the box or support bracket  is slightly recessed.  You do NOT get a new support bracket with this fixture but you can usually use the 2 screw holes on the circumference of the box.  Once you tighten the two screws, twist the cover in place and you are done installing.  Once you restore the power, the light will flash white light of different hues.  To connect the light to your smart phone, you scan the QR on the card that came with the fixture and follow the prompts.  If your router is in range everything should go smoothly, and you will be connected within a minute of clicking on “Add a Device” in the app—just as advertised.  There is a downside to smart lights in that they must be set to on in app when the switch is on.  You are controlling the light and NOT the switch.  In some situations, however, this is an advantage.  
The name “Hubspace” seems like a misnomer at first to me.  There is NO hub needed for any of the products it supports to function.  The app, a smart phone and your Wi-Fi router are what is necessary.  You create an account but there is no initial or monthly fee.  Right now, there are about 5 dozen items that the app will support but more are planned.  The app provides 3 modes of behavior after power failure, which provide for not interrupting sleep (SlEEP), providing full lighting for safe movement (SAFETY) and return to where the light was last set (DEFAULT).  I look forward to installing more Hubspace products soon.  I also hope The Home Depot finds a way to support existing devices that connect to hubs such as Wink and Smart Things as well as generic Z-Wave devices.  Even if it does require a hub at some point or a bridge, having one place to control as many home automation from a single app as possible.",HomeDepotCustomer
2021-11-04T18:29:42,5,I love voice control!,"OK - I didn't need a new kitchen light. But being able to control it by voice was too hard to resist. Our kitchen only has a light switch by the outside door. I want to add another switch, but getting down the outside wall is almost impossible in this house. So being able to control the light with Alexa is great. Just being able to turn it off and on would have been a big improvement. Being able to dim it, and change the color is an added bonus. I don't see using the color extremes, but changing the tint of the white is handy. Then again, 5% blue makes a great nightlight.

The pictures do not do a good job of showing the color of the light. It comes out white, with the color showing in the shadow of the light.",Mikkel
2021-11-02T22:04:36,5,over head lighting finally,This led light was just what I needed brings quite a bit of light into the room and Alexa will dim and turn off and on with just a word. Very easy to replace the existing ceiling light that I had to get a ladder to change the bulbs a little to often. This came with screws and wire nuts to finish the installation. This has the option of changing colors as well from green to blue and red and colors in between in the alexa app instead of the hubspace app.,kid1
2021-11-02T11:56:46,5,Hubspace Exclusives,"A few years ago, you only got a Smart RGB (i.e. Red/Green/Blue Full Color Spectrum) Bulb for this price.  Now, you get an entire Smart RGB Fixture.  The quality is what you would expect for the price, and the fact it is ultimately disposable (e.g. the lens is plastic, not glass; do have 5yr Warranty), but I could see many applications for these.  They are Damp Rated.  So, I am using in my basement.  They are 1400 Lumens; which is the equivalent of a 100W Incandescent.  The Hubspace App and products, are Exclusive to Home Depot.  I already have a Device (Hampton Bay Ceiling Fan Remote) that uses Hubspace.  Set up was easy, using the included QR Code.  It even remembered my WiFi and its Password.  I love the fact you can set the Temperature (i.e. Tunable White 2700-6500K).   Having all the light the same Temp in a room, looks much nicer.  I also like they are RGB.  Many of my lights are, and I like to set color themes for the Holidays.  Got these just in time for Halloween.  My whole house was lit Red at night.  Looks creepy cool!  They are Dimmable, you can set a Schedule (e.g. On at Dusk, Off at 10PM), you can Group them, they have Preset options (see pics) and voice controlled via an Alexa Skill or Google.  Another benefit, besides Flat Panel lights, these have to be the most 'Flush' lights available; at just over 2"".  In my basement, where the ceiling is very low, the 4"" difference between these and my old bulbs, is the difference between hitting my head when I load laundry or not.",TheDogsCar
2021-11-02T06:26:31,5,"extremely easy to install, very bright and adjustable, easily integrates with smart home functionality","Looks great, very bright and adjustable through an entire range from low light to very bright in addition to light temperature from a yellowish to bright white.  The app works well and is very easy to integrate, in my case, with Alexa.  Its low profile makes it most suitable in areas with lower ceilings.  I mounted it in a short hall which leads to my guest bath and bedrooms.  I replaced an original contractor light which, in my opinion, never gave off enough light.  This solved that problem.  Additionally, I can dim the light way down and use it as a night light for the entire area.  It was very easy to install, probably the easiest I have come across.  It took about twenty minutes for one person to install, download the app and integrate with my smart home functionality.  Very impressed.  ",MIKE
2021-11-01T19:39:26,5,"Easy to install, fun to use.","Rather than buying the grandkids more toys for Christmas this year, I tried to think of something that wouldn’t be lost, broken or outgrown within a few weeks. I think they’ll really like this light – they have a Google “mini” in the playroom so they will be able to turn the light on and off, control the brightness, change the colors, etc. by voice.  With Christmas still a couple of months away, I set it up on the workbench to check out the installation process and the app. 

Installation is simple if you have a standard electrical box. Remove the old fixture, connect the hot, neutral and ground wires, attach the fixture to the ceiling box and tighten it up flush with the ceiling. Rotate the plastic lens cover into place and you are done. 

Included in the box is a card with a QR code. Scan that with your phone to download the Hubspace app, then follow directions to register and connect to the light fixture. While I'm not thrilled to have yet another app on my phone, once installed you can connect to Alexa or Google and won't need to open the app again.",BKTX
2024-12-06T13:08:38,5,Easy to set up on the app.,Very simple to install and set up with the app on my phone and with Alexa. I didn't think I would bother with the colours but they are great for nightlights. I also like that I can easily change the value of the white light.,Sher

2) The Hubspace App was able to control the white light settings without issue. However, when I attempted color light settings the light turned off.  Hubspace support was unable to rectify and they finally blamed the light as defective.  The support team told me to return the light which I did.

The metal bent just tightening everything to flush, which caused the screw head to pop through the slotted screw channel.  Had to make a separate trip to the hardware to get a washer to keep the screw head where it's supposed to be.  Just really poor quality material and design to have that part of the fixture deform so easily during installation.  Don't buy.",DJ123

I took off a star because the app can be flaky on it's connection to the light.  Even if I'm right next to the light I can lose connection intermittently making it hard to sometimes change the settings.  It's not a huge issue because I tend to keep it one settings and use the switch to turn it on and off, but even just playing around with it and changing colors it will lose connection.",Greg

The light itself is very easy to install and is lighter than a metal fixture. The light is adjustable via WIFI yet our friends have not done this for now. The lights do produce a very good amount of light and the frosted glass helps to not be as harsh.,Miller Tyme

Matte Black Smart CCT and RGB Work Selectable LED Flush Mount with Hubspace App is easy to set up and packed with great features.  To set up the fixture is very intuitive.  You first download the Hubspace APP, register, and scan the product QR code and that’s it.   You can remotely control the light with your phone or using Alexa or Google. The best of this light is other than dimming, and you can also change its color. There are several preset colors that you can select. I like that there is a video online on the product page that shows the general setup process.   It is a good product.",Typicaldude
